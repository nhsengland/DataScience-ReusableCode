<h1>Welcome</h1>

This site brings together various pieces of reusable code that the NHS England Data Science team has developed.   

Each codebase has been designed using the [reproducible analytical pipeline](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/) principles aimed at ICS and trust analysts across the NHS.
