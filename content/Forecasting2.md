This repo is a more advanced look into univariate forecasting.  
The techniques used in this repo are ARIMA, SARIMAX and a look into Facebook's Prophet Forecasting model. 
As there is a lot to understand before you can deploy a SARIMAX model, the repo will take you through the necessary data investigation steps, and explore the intricacies of the datastream, and the necessary knowledge steps before you can deploy a SARIMAX model. 

You can find the [code here](https://github.com/nhsx/Time_Series_Forecasting_MS)

A second repo focussed on <a href="/DataScience/ReusableCode/Forecasting1">Forecasting Introduction</a> is also availble with some initial steps and a look into other types of Forecasting models
