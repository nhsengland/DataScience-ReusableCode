# {{page.title}}

We wish to demonstrate how **hypergraphs** can be used to capture relationships between multiple diseases rather than relationships between pairs of diseases. For example, looking at multimorbidity patterns instead of just comorbidities, which standard graphs tend to do. More people are suffering from multiple chronic diseases at the same time, so it's important to think about how we can find patterns in the uptake of multimoribidities, to see if prevention techniques or treatments could be put in place sooner to improve the quality of life in patients.

On this [Streamlit App](https://nhsx-hypergraphical-streamlit-hypergraphs-hklixt.streamlit.app/) you can find out a bit more about what multimorbidity is and some types of graphs including standard graphs, undirected hypergraphs and directed hypergraphs.

*Note: if you sign into a streamlit account *note you may need to restart the app as it turns off after a period of low usage*

You can find the [code here](https://github.com/nhsx/hypergraphical)
