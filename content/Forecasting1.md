This repo is a simple introduction and guide to some of the Data Science tools available for Time Series Forecasting. 
There are numerous different models covered within this repo, each with a workbook to guide you through each step of the path. 
Univariate (single datastream) and Multivariate data are covered in the data folder. 

Within this repo, there are several ways of going about Time Series Forecasting (TSF). When you come to look at a dataset, and the question is, how do I predict y from my existing data, quite often the area that's hardest is knowing where to begin, how to go about the forecasting, and what method is most appropriate, and which method will give you the best results.

What this repo will do, is try and guide you through this forest, so you can see the wood for the trees. The repo will only cover numerical forecasting, so regression style forecasting, as opposed to classification (binary) forecasting.

You can find the [code here](https://github.com/nhsx/Forecasting)

A second repo on forecasting is also availble with more advanced techniques and a deeper exploration into <a href="/DataScience/ReusableCode/Forecasting2">Univariate Forecasting</a>.
