A Discrete Event Simulation (DES) using [R-Simmer](https://r-simmer.org/) to investigate the ambulance job cycle times.   The code has been designed with reuse by analysts in an ambulance trusts in mind.  


You can find the [code here](https://github.com/nhsengland/AmbModelOpen)

A precursor to this work was an earlier proof of concept R-simmer discrete event simulation for the ambulance setting called [AmbSim](https://github.com/nhsx/ambulance-DES).  This code has a couple of additional features (e.g. an escalation dynamic) which might be useful to be aware of alongside AmbModelOpen.
